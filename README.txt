This is setup for Bash on linux.  It customizes the terminal, adds vimrc stuff
and does plenty of other interesting stuff too.  This was from Jason Tikalsky 
when I worked for University of Wisconsin - Computer Aided Engineering.  I have 
put my own twists on it since of course.

To run, just copy the contents to the root of your home and run 'source .bashrc'
